## Prerequisites

Before running the Nockchain GUI Wallet, ensure you have the following installed:

### Nockchain CLI

- Nockchain CLI must be installed with all dependencies
- Nockchain-wallet should be on the newest version
- A Nockchain node must be running and synced to the latest block height

### System Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Tkinter** (usually included with Python)
- **Pillow** (PIL) for image handling
- **Requests** for API calls

### Dependencies

```bash
pip install pillow requests
```

## Installation

### Linux/Ubuntu

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update

# Install Python and Tkinter
sudo apt install python3 python3-tk python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install pillow requests
```

### macOS

```bash
# Install Python (if not already installed)
brew install python3

# Install dependencies
pip3 install pillow requests
```

### Windows

```bash
# Install Python from python.org
# During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

# Install dependencies
pip install pillow requests
```

## Setup

1. **Place Files**: Copy all wallet files into your Nockchain directory
2. **Ensure Node**: Make sure your Nockchain node is running and fully synced
3. **Icons**: Ensure `wallet.png` and `wallet.icon` are in the same directory as the main script

## Usage

### Running the Wallet

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### First Time Setup

1. Launch the application
2. Create a new wallet or import existing keys
3. The wallet will automatically connect to your local Nockchain node
4. Start managing your NOCK assets!

### Key Features Usage

#### Creating a Wallet

- Click the "‚ú® Create Wallet" button
- Follow the on-screen instructions

#### Sending Transactions

- Enter sender address, recipient address, amount, and fee
- Click "Send" to broadcast the transaction

#### Managing Addresses

- Click "üîë Get Addresses" to load your wallet addresses
- Use "üí∞ Balance" to check specific address balances

#### Nocknames

- Use the "üë® Names" feature to resolve human-readable names
- Convert between addresses and Nocknames

## Building Standalone Application

### macOS (using py2app)

```bash
# Install py2app
pip3 install py2app

# Build the application
python3 setup.py py2app
```

This will create a standalone `.app` bundle in the `dist/` directory.

## Configuration

The wallet uses several configuration constants defined in `constants.py`:

- API endpoints for price data and Nocknames
- UI colors and styling
- Default window dimensions
- gRPC connection settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No module named 'tkinter'"**

   - Install Tkinter: `sudo apt install python3-tk` (Linux)
   - Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python on macOS and Windows

2. **Connection Issues**

   - Ensure your Nockchain node is running
   - Check that the node is synced to the latest block height
   - Verify network connectivity

3. **Icon Not Loading**

   - Ensure `wallet.png` exists in the application directory
   - Check file permissions

4. **API Errors**
   - Check internet connectivity for price data
   - Nocknames resolution requires internet access

### Logs and Debugging

The wallet provides detailed logging in the output panel. Check the logs for error messages and connection status.

## Security Notes

- Always backup your wallet keys
- Use strong passwords for encrypted wallets
- Verify transaction details before sending
